# NinjaScript strategies for QuantVue indicators

These are strategies in C# files to be added to NinjaTrader in order to automate your trading. 

They require an active license from [QuantVue](https://www.quantvue.io) in order to use the indicators.

I am actively forward testing these strategies, the results of which you can see in my [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13GEn5-fEMmgHHa7D3HUARmFuh4muIJzuGl-1CxAjZJw/edit?usp=sharing).

These strategies are public and free to use, but all I ask is that you join the [Discord community](https://discord.gg/tC7u7magU3) and help pay it forward by sharing your results or improvements to the code.
